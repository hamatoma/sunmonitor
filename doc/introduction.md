# Objective
I have put a "balcony power plant" (mini photovoltaic system) into operation. With this project the "harvest" can be displayed.
This objective gave the project its name.
 
The Shelly (TM) brand offers modules that can be used to query their status (measured values) via WiFi.

The SunMonitor project offers programs that collect this data (SunMon module) and display it (SunServer module).

There is also the SunApi program, which, as a proxy server, reduces the interface of the Shelly module to a pure query:
If the interface is enabled in the network, block data can be changed. The proxy server prevents this.
